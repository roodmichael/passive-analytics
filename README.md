# Passive Analytics
> A leightweight pluggable framework for collecting web application usage.

Passive Analytics is a personal project to explore passive metrics collection patterns that do not pollute the codebase with metrics related code. Because this is a side project, I make no promises and do not recommend using it for any serious purposes.
